        <h2> Overview </h2>
        <hr /> <img src="/Website/Pictures/XJS500.jpg" alt="Body Fit for Life Device" title="Body Fit for Life Device" width="200" height="200">
        <p> <hr /> The <i> XJS500 </i> is a <del>good</del> <ins>amazing</ins> <b> upgrade </b> to the previous <i> XKS300 </i> model, featuring a new resistence-band sytem
that users <del> will find easy to use. </del> 
<br /> Designed for both serious fitness buffs and beginners, the
<i> XJS500 </i> provides easy setup and storage with built-in holsters for extra bands and bars.
While still allowing for users to work out with light weights or their own body weight, 
the <i> XJS500 </i> is designed for all users at any stage of their fitness needs. The resistance bands 
range from 5 lb. to 25 lb.  Additional bands can be purchased as necessary.
<br /> The <i> XJS500 </i> is safe and easy to use and can be used alone or with a partner. The locking points
prevent the bar from moving outside the normal range of motion. Since there are no heavy plates,
you don't have to worry about dropping anything that could damage your floor. The resistance
bands are made of sturdy, hard rubber rated for the resistance marked on each side.
<br />
The <i> XJS500 </i> can be configured to perform a number of different exercises. The detached bench
is adjustable for both incline and decline workouts, with detachable leg-and bicep-curl attachments.
The basic package includes resistence bands for workouts of up to 200 lb. Additional bands
can be purchased separately. All accessories are easy to install or store, allowing you to
change your workout routine as often as you like. The basic package comes with a straight bar,
tricep rope, bicep curl bar, ankle strap, and triangle bar. Additional accessories sold 
separately include: lat/row bar, curved bar, rams horns bar, and various tricep pull-down bars.
<br />
The <i> XJS500 </i> storage makes it easy to store all accessories and bands in one place for easy access.
This makes the <i> XJS500 </i> an excellent choice for people who want a quality home gym while avoiding 
paying for a professional gym membership.

    <ul> 
        <li> Smooth resistance: The bands are rated appropriately and provide proper tension.

a compatible workout. </li>

you lose your grip on the bar. </li>
